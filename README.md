# Bare-Acts-Update-Engine
Maintaining up-to-date versions of BARE Acts is a significant challenge due to continuous updates and decentralized publication, often leading to outdated legal references. Our application addresses this issue by developing a comprehensive BARE Act Update Engine that automates the detection, retrieval, and integration of updates using advanced technologies like Natural Language Processing (NLP). Additionally, it consists of a user-interface that assists users in efficiently accessing and navigating the updated legal texts. This project not only enhances legal reference accuracy but also aligns with SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions).
